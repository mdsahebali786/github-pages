1. What is phishing?
Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information—such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data—by posing as a legitimate entity, usually via deceptive emails, messages, or websites.
Phishing is a form of social engineering, and it's one of the most common and dangerous threats in cybersecurity.
2. How to identify a phishing email?

    The following signs can often identify phishing emails:
    Spoofed or suspicious sender address (e.g., service@paypa1.com)
    Urgent or threatening language ("Your account will be suspended!")
    Generic greetings ("Dear user")
    Mismatched or strange-looking URLs (hover reveals real link)
    Unexpected attachments or download requests
    Spelling or grammar errors
    Lack of personal or account-specific information

3. What is email spoofing?
Email spoofing is the process of forging the sender’s email address to make it appear as though the message comes from a trusted source.
Attackers use spoofing to deceive recipients into opening phishing emails or clicking malicious links.
Technically, it exploits the lack of authentication in the SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

4. Why are phishing emails dangerous?
Phishing emails are dangerous because:
They steal sensitive data like login credentials or financial information.
They may install malware, ransomware, or spyware.
They can lead to identity theft and financial fraud.

5. How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?
To verify a sender's authenticity:
Check the sender’s email address carefully for misspellings or extra characters.
Use email header analysis tools to inspect the full delivery path.
Hover over links to check their true destinations.
Cross-check with official websites or contacts.
For critical emails, contact the sender directly via an official channel (not by replying to the email).

 6. What tools can analyze email headers?
  Popular tools to analyze and verify email headers include:
 MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer
Google Admin Toolbox - Messageheader
Cisco Talos Intelligence
 MailHeader.org
Built-in email client header views (Outlook, Gmail, Thunderbird)

 7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?
When a phishing email is suspected:
Do not click any links or download attachments.
Do not reply to the email.
Report the email to your IT/security team.
